  I like to say that I have a very big imagination, and usually I like to imagine certain concepts--such as video games,
  pieces of technology, businesses, and more--in hopes that one day I will have the knowledge to make them a reality! 
  Here, you may find some ideas, with dates on them of course, and then refer to the "Projects" tab to see that I have
  learned enough of a language to make it real! As I'm writing this, there's not much now, but there will hopefully be more
  in the near future.
