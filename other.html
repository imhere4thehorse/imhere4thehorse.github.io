 What I would consider one of my best traits is that I am a risk taker. I desire adventure.
 I want to see everything the world has to offer, so I like to explore a variety of subjects and activities. 
 This page gives you a glimpse to a few things that I am passionate about.

<h2>My love letter to figure skating</h2>
<p>I never actually touched a pair of ice skates until April of 2022, when I attended Colorado College's admitted Student open
  house. On that day, I ate dinner with other incoming students and the staff announced that there will be two events for students to attend--an
 open skate, or an opera show. I was so curious what it would be like to skate that I immediately ran to the rink afterwards to try it out for myself.
 It took me two hours to finally move on the ice after sticking to the wall and falling over and over again. I didn't even look that cool! I ran on the ice. Literally ran!
  <br>
 <br>
 Even so, that was the spark that led me to pursue a passion in ice skating.
 <br>
 <br>
 At the beginning of the school year, I found out that Colorado College had a figure skating team open to all levels, so I immediately joined it and attended 
 every single practice. It was really hard to wake up in the morning, especially when it was dark and cold in the winter, but the thought of it made me so excited
 that I was able to fight the desire to go back to sleep and make my way out of the dorm. At the time of writing this, it is March 1st, 2022. I made it from a
 complete beginner that ran on the ice to representing my school in an intercollegiate competition at the University of California, San Diego, in just 8 short months.
 <br>
 <br>
All of the hard work that I put in to learn the different spins, jumps, and footwork allowed me to officially learn an entire skating program in time for the
last competition of the season. It is an experience that gave me confidence and helped me believe that I really can accomplish anything when I put my mind
 to it. It is a sport that brings me so much joy, which is why every moment I spend on the ice is a moment I always fall in love with.

<h2>I'm here for the horse</h2>
<p>You may have noticed from my github username that I'm really into horses. It's true. I've always loved horses ever since I was a child. Maybe it's the
 feeling of freedom that I enjoy whenever I canter a horse. Maybe it's something more.
  <br>
 <br>
 Horseback riding was always a difficult sport for me to get into because of the expenses, so I was only able to ride a few times each summer. 
 I really took my time to appreciate the process of working with horses since I don't get to experience them as often as I would like, but in the summer of
 2022, I was able to get a job as a horse wrangler for HRCA, so I was able to spend more time working with horses by leading trails and performing ranch duties. 
 The more I worked with these animals, the more I realized how smart and stupid they can be. Just like people sometimes. In an early lesson or shift, I would
 need to wake up the horses and get them ready for the day. Sometimes they would pin their ears back in anger as I led them to the hitching fence, grumpy about
 waking up so early in the morning. It was just like how I would act when I have to wake up in the morning too. 
 <br>
 <br>
 The more horses I worked with, the more I realized that not every horse can connect with me. Something that I didn't fully comprehend was that horses were more
 similar to people than I realized. Just like how you wouldn't necesarily get along with every person you meet, even if you really wanted to, I might not
be the best at riding certain horses because we don't get along that well. I reflected on this concept a lot recently. Many barns teach riders proper techniques
 on how to ride every horse. The best riders should be able to ride any horse, but I wanted to take a step back and reflect on why I wanted to be a rider. It wasn't
 because I wanted to be the very best rider that can ride any horse given to me. I wanted to be a rider because I wanted to experience that bond with a horse. This
 was the "something more" that made me love horses as much as I do. I don't need to be the best rider in the world, but I do need to know how to ride the one horse
 that I can call my own.
 <br>
 <br>
 One of my biggest dreams is to own a horse. I want this horse to be my ride or die, with a personality that I can relate to. We should both like speed, trying new things,
 and exploring the natural world together. When I am completely prepared--with a stable job and my own property--I'll look for that horse, my future partner in crime.

<h2>"Take me with you, let me see the world!" - Kozuki Oden</h2>
<p>I love to travel and see the world since I think there is always something enriching that I am able to learn from 
 visiting a place I have never seen before.
