  PLACE RESUME HERE
 </p>
 
 <p>
  I am 18 years old and I recently graduated ThunderRidge High School with a High School Diploma and an IB Diploma.
  I am going to attend Colorado College as a Computer Science major and I am super exicted to learn more in school!
  During high school, I volunteered extensively at a variety of different organizations and I recieved many awards for
  academic excellence. I temporarily work as a Horse Wrangler at the Highlands Ranch Community Association, where I get 
  to continue my passion for horses and fund my college education!

</p>

<p>
  One of my biggest goals is to gain valuable work experience as well as learn even more in the Computer Science field 
  through an internship at Lockheed Martin.

</p>

<p>
  I became interested in the Computer Science field this past year, so my skills are not as extensive. My goal for this 
  website is to document my projects and the skills I have learned.
