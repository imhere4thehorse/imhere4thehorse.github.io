 I am a first year student at Colorado College, a small liberal arts school in Colorado Springs. Although it isn't a school that has a heavy
 focus in the tech field, I chose to attend this school to study Computer Science because of the unique way of thinking a liberal arts education
 will offer me.
 <br>
 <br>
 A liberal arts education, especially at Colorado College, offers me a vastly different educational experience and perspective than traditional universities.
 <br>
 <br>
 At CC, I learn by the <a href="https://www.coloradocollege.edu/basics/blockplan/">Block Plan</a>, which means that I am taking only one course for 3.5 weeks.
 As of November, I am currently in Block 3, and my experience from the first two blocks, as well as a two week block before class officially started during 
 my time in the <a href="https://www.coloradocollege.edu/other/bridge/">Bridge Scholars Program</a>, I learned to be quickly be adaptable. Personally,
 I found that the Block Plan doesn't allow me to truly settle in and relax in my class, which means I must be able to think effectively and engage myself in
 my education in order to understand the content within my class. The second I feel somewhat used to my environment in one block, I am suddenly thrust into
 a different block--possibly with very different concepts--and I must adapt to the pace and the content of the course. This happened to me during Blocks 1 and 2.
 For Block 1, I had a class called Acting and Directing for the Cinema, which was greatly different from Block 2, Foundations of Discrete Mathematics. Yet, I had to quickly
 make the adjustment to succeed in my following block.
 <br>
 Not only am I learning the skills to work well under pressure and adapt to greatly different environments, but I am also getting the opportunity to support my
 journey in my pursuit of a Computer Science degree through intellectual grounding in many different fields. In order to graduate Colorado College, students must
 complete their <a href="https://www.coloradocollege.edu/other/generaleducation/requirements.html">General Education</a> requirements, which allows students to expand
 their knowledge and thinking through analysis and interpretation of meaning, creative processes, formal reasoning, historical perspectives, scientific analysis,
 interpretation of socities and human behavior, education in equity and power, as well as engagement through language(both foreign and native). Although some
 of the subjects I am learning are not necessarily related to Computer Science, the way those courses shape my thinking and my perspective can greatly improve
 the way I handle situations within the field.
  <br>
 <br>
  Although I don't go to a school with a heavy focus on STEM courses, I have a strong desire to learn more about the Computer Science Field.
  I became interested in the Computer Science field this past year, but my enthusiasm for this subject
  motivated me to self-study languages such as Python, CSS, and HTML as well as take upper-level classes
  (that mostly sophomores and juniors take) as a freshman in college.
<br> 
   <p>
  I worked hard to take as many computer science courses as I can as well as immerse myself more within the field in order to
  gain better experience with coding, software development, and soft skills, which are crucial within the industry. 
    <br>
    I have
  experience researching with Colorado College's <a href="https://www.coloradocollege.edu/other/bridge/pathways-score-program.html">Pathways to SCoRE</a> research assistant position. This program is an aspect of
   the Bridge Program--a diversity, equity, and inclusion program that connects first generation, low income, and underrepresented minority
    students with each other in a predominantly white university. This position not only allows me to gain experience learning
    how to predict and generate graphs utilizing the machine learning framework PyTorch in the Python language, but I will have experience
    collaborating with different people and combining our diverse strengths to potentially present the research at a machine learning conference.
    <br>
    I recently accepted an offer as a Business Analyst Intern at Lockheed Martin Space at the Highlands Ranch location.
    This summer, I will have the opportunity to connect with many different interns and employees at the aerospace defense company
    and gain experience in business--especially in the business and technolofy areas of Lockheed Martin Space--by 
    supporting the business analysts with financial modeling, crafting market, customer, and competitive analysis,
    information synthesis, and business capture. 
    <br>
   I am also the new Co-Leader of Colorado College's Coding Club. My main responsibilities are to collaborate with the other Co-Leader
    of the club, the Treasurer, and the Social Media manager to support any student interested in coding and the technology field through
    blockly club events and opportunities.
  <br>
 My past experience in High School also helped me hone and develop the critical
 and creative thinking skills that are crucial to this industry through my involvement in the Technology Student Association (TSA)
 club in my high school and challenging myself to take difficult, upper level courses. I recieved several awards
 for both my creative and logistical thinking, notably the 2nd Place Award in the Biotechnology Design event for a TSA competition
 and a Silver Key in Science Fiction and Fantasy Writing for the Scholastic Art and Writing Awards competition. My skills
 in both creative thinking and critical thinking as well as technical and creative writing
    will further enhance my education and experience within the field of Computer Science.
