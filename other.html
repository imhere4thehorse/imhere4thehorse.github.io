 Here's a list of fun facts about me that aren't completely related to my professional life! Many apologies, but it's currently under construction!
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
1. I love to figure skate! I just got into the sport in April and I'm currently on the Colorado College Figure Skating Team! Although I'm not quite good enough at skating to compete for the team, I'm working hard on my Basic Eights! I currently am working on crossovers. This truly brings me so much joy!
</p>
 <p>
2. Another sport that I love is horseback riding! I am also involved in the CC Equestrian team and learning the Hunt-seat style. Nothing has ever felt so natural to me than horseback riding--I feel the happiest when I am on a horse!
</p>
 <p>
3. I love to travel and see the world since I think there is always something enriching that I am able to learn from visiting a place I have never seen before. I want to see everything the world has to offer.
