  Hi! My name is Kalie! I am a freshman student at Colorado College and I plan on majoring in Computer Science!
  I think the most satisfying thing about Computer Science is when a code finally works out after 
  you've been working on it for ages. When it doesn't work out, it's quite stressful, but that just
  makes it more satisfying in the end.

  Anyways, welcome to my GitHub page! Feel free to look around to learn more about me.
