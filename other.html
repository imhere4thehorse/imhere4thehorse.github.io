 What I would consider one of my best traits is that I am a risk taker. I desire adventure.
 I want to see everything the world has to offer, so I like to explore a variety of subjects and activities. 
 This page gives you a glimpse to a few things that I am passionate about.

1. I love to figure skate! I just got into the sport in April and I'm currently on the Colorado College Figure Skating Team! 
 I absolutely love to spin on the ice! It makes me very dizzy, but I'll get used to it! This truly brings me so much joy!
</p>
 <p>
2. Another sport that I love is horseback riding! 
  I am also involved in the CC Equestrian team and learning the Hunt-seat style. 
  Nothing has ever felt so natural to me than horseback riding--I feel the happiest when I am on a horse!

3. I love to travel and see the world since I think there is always something enriching that I am able to learn from visiting a place I have never seen before. 
  I want to see everything the world has to offer.
