 Hi! My name is Kalie and welcome to my Github website! I am a first year student at Colorado College and I am definitely planning on majoring in 
 Computer Science! This personal website serves as a portfolio to document my experience within Computer Science, so it will be regularly updated 
 as I continue to take more courses within the field.

Coding can seem very intimidating to those that are starting out. It certainly was for me. However, something I realized when I took my very first 
 computer science course (Computer Science I) course at CC is that as long as I am smarter than the computer, than I can confidently learn how to code.
 Just think of it like you're telling a less intelligent creature what to do. It is so unintelligent that it can't infer anything, so you must clearly define
 everything you are going to tell the creature to do.

 In my Computer Science I class, I remember that on day one, the professor told us computers are quite dumb. Sometimes I can be quite dumb as well. So, as
 long as I am not dumber than the computer, I can effectively code, and that is the notion that supports my journey in Computer Science!
