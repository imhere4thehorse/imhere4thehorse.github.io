  Hi! My name is Kalie! I am a first year student at Colorado College and I plan on majoring in Computer Science!
  I think the most satisfying thing about Computer Science is when a code finally works out after 
  you've been working on it for ages. When it doesn't work out, it's quite stressful, but that just
  makes it more satisfying in the end when you are able to complete it!
</p>

  Anyways, welcome to my GitHub page! I made it mobile friendly as well, so it looks like a pretty interesting
 poem if you open it on your phone. Please feel free to look around to learn a little more about me!
