 What I would consider one of my best traits is that I am a risk taker. I desire adventure.
 I want to see everything the world has to offer, so I like to explore a variety of subjects and activities. 
 This page gives you a glimpse to a few things that I am passionate about.

<h2>My love letter to figure skating</h2>
<p>I never actually touched a pair of ice skates until April of 2022, when I attended Colorado College's admitted Student open
  house. On that day, I ate dinner with other incoming students and the staff announced that there will be two events for students to attend--an
 open skate, or an opera show. I was so curious what it would be like to skate that I immediately ran to the rink afterwards to try it out for myself.
 It took me two hours to finally move on the ice after sticking to the wall and falling over and over again. I didn't even look that cool! I ran on the ice. Literally ran!
  <br>
 Even so, that was the spark that led me to pursue a passion in ice skating.
 <br>
 At the beginning of the school year, I found out that Colorado College had a figure skating team open to all levels, so I immediately joined it and attended 
 every single practice. It was really hard to wake up in the morning, especially when it was dark and cold in the winter, but the thought of it made me so excited
 that I was able to fight the desire to go back to sleep and make my way out of the dorm. At the time of writing this, it is March 1st, 2022. I made it from a
 complete beginner that ran on the ice to representing my school in an intercollegiate competition at the University of California, San Diego, in just 8 short months.
 <br>
All of the hard work that I put in to learn the different spins, jumps, and footwork allowed me to officially learn an entire skating program in time for the
last competition of the season. It is an experience that gave me confidence and helped me believe that I really can accomplish anything when I put my mind
 to it. It is a sport that brings me so much joy, which is why every moment I spend on the ice is a moment I always fall in love with.

<p>Nothing has ever felt so natural to me than horseback riding--I feel the happiest when I am on a horse!

<h2>"Take me with you, let me see the world!" - Kozuki Oden</h2>
<p>I love to travel and see the world since I think there is always something enriching that I am able to learn from 
 visiting a place I have never seen before.
