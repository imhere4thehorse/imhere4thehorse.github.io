  Here are some of the languages I know and some projects I have created with these languages!!
</p>

 <article>
<h2>Python</h2>
<p> This was the first programming language I learned. I was able to learn basic Python through self study, but I gained experience in machine learning with Python 
 and the Pytorch framework through a research assistant position at Colorado College.
 <br>
 <br>
   <span class="bolded">Python Self-Taught Project:</span> <a href="https://github.com/imhere4thehorse/Very-Basic-Chatbot"> Basic Chatbot</a>
   <br>
  <br>
   <span class="bolded"> Pathways to SCoRe Machine Learning Research:</span> Currently working on computing features of a graph/training a neural network on those features,
  utilizing numpy to compute the Laplacian of each graph, computing the eigenvalues of each graph laplacian, and training a neural network on those features, and
  applying a Graph Convolutional Network to predict the labels directly.

  The link to this project is coming soon! For now, you can take a look at my <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/179NqoEGzV2YxUTA-T5bddfTYoIxB_r25G7bucOqTB6o/edit?usp=sharing"> work log</a>!</p>

  <article>
<h2>HTML</h2>
<p> HTML is to create the structure of this website. 94% of the website is HTML according to GitHub. It is also a language that I self studied.
 <br>
 <br>
 Interested in what the code looks like? Click <a href="https://github.com/imhere4thehorse/imhere4thehorse.github.io">here</a>
   <br>
   (Did you also know this website is mobile friendly? Why don't you try opening it on your phone!)</p>
</article>
 
   <article>
<h2>CSS</h2>
<p> CSS to make this website look visually appealing. 6% of the website is CSS according to GitHub. I really love art, so my favorite
  part of CSS is getting to pick just the right shade of lavender with the hexadecimals! It is also another language I self studied.

 <article>
<h2>Java</h2>
<p> I learned Java and through the courses Computer Science I (CP122) and Computer Science II (CP222). I will also gain even more experience with Java through an upcoming
 course in May, Data Structures and Algorithms (CP307).
 <br>

   <span class="bolded">Computer Science I Final Project:</span> <a href="https://github.com/imhere4thehorse/CP122-Project">Gettin' to a Street Fight</a>
   <br>
  Please take a look at the README if you are interested in playing the game!
        <br>
 <span class="bolded">Computer Science II Final Project:</span> <a href="https://github.com/comp-sci-2">Digital Ledger System utilizing servers</a>
Please take a look at the Final Report if you are interested in trying out the program!

<h2>R</h2>
<p> I learned R through the Probability and Statistical Modelling Course (MA217). We had several assignments that had to deal with R, including a final project.
 I included a few below.
