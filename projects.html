  Here are some of the languages I know and some projects I have created with these languages!!
</p>

 <article>
<h2>Python</h2>
<p> This was the first programming language I learned. I was able to learn basic Python through self study, but I gained experience in machine learning with Python 
 and the Pytorch framework through a research assistant position at Colorado College.

  <br>
   <span class="bolded"> Pathways to SCoRe Machine Learning Research:</span> Currently working on computing features of a graph/training a neural network on those features,
  utilizing numpy to compute the Laplacian of each graph, computing the eigenvalues of each graph laplacian, and training a neural network on those features, and
  applying a Graph Convolutional Network to predict the labels directly.

  The link to this project is coming soon! For now, you can take a look at my <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/179NqoEGzV2YxUTA-T5bddfTYoIxB_r25G7bucOqTB6o/edit?usp=sharing"> work log</a>!</p>

  <span class="bolded">Data Structures and Algorithms Final Project: Predator and Prey Path Simulation
   <br>
  <object width="600" height="830" data="dsa.pdf"></object>
  <br>
   
  README:
  Our final utilized Dijkstra's Algorithm to create a predator and prey simulation where the predator and the prey 
  have the goal of finding the shortest path to their target. In the simulation, the goal of the predator is to catch 
  the predator while the goal of the predator is to escape the predator. The predator can catch the prey when their indexes and 
  nodes are the same–indicating that they are at the same place at the same time–while the prey can successfully evade the predator 
   when the prey reaches their target node. In the case that the predator reaches the prey when the prey reaches their target node, 
   we programmed the simulation so that the predator can successfully catch the prey in that scenario. 

  For the default, we set the predator location to be on the node (0,9) and the prey location to be on node (0,0) to try and make the 
  chances of success for both predator and prey as fair as possible. The graph where the simulation takes place is a 10x10 grid graph, 
  which can be adjusted according to the user’s preference by adjusting the number in G = nx.grid_2d_graph(10, 10) and pos = {(i, j): 
  (i, j) for i in range(10) for j in range(10)}.

	In the predator and prey class, Dijkstra's Algorithm was implemented so the predator and prey could calculate their shortest path. 
 The experiment begins with the four methods: simulation1(), simulation2(), simulation3(), and simulation4(). This provides the results 
 when you experiment with only one prey and one predator. 
	
	We attempted a situation where you could experiment with 5 predator and 5 prey at the same time, 
 which was sim1(). We planned to have a sim2(), sim3(), and sim4() to be very similar to simulation1(), simulation2(), 
 simulation3(), and simulation4(). Due to time constraints, we unfortunately weren’t able to complete this feature, 
 but the code is still visible at the bottom of the .ipynb file.

	Notice how in all 4 simulations, there is a label for ‘1’, ‘2’, ‘3’, and ‘4’. Each number 
 represents a different combination of predator and prey strategies:

	1	PREDATOR STRATEGY: Set the predator's target as the prey's target
PREY STRATEGY: Set the prey's target to a random node in the graph

	2	PREDATOR STRATEGY: Set the predator's target as the prey's target
PREY STRATEGY: Set the prey's target to the node furthest from the predator

	3	PREDATOR STRATEGY: Set the predator's target to the prey's next node
PREY STRATEGY: Set the prey's target to a random node in the graph

	4	PREDATOR STRATEGY: Set the predator's target to the prey's next node
PREY STRATEGY: Set the prey's target to the node furthest from the predator


To use the program, please run through all the cells. If you want to experiment with the different simulations, 
 then please run the methods first before you run the cell where you call the methods. Occasionally, it can take a second for the 
experiment to run, so if you see ‘In[*]’, you should stop the cell from running with the stop button and rerun the cell with the 
methods before running the cell where the method is called. 

We hope you enjoy this experiment.

<h2>HTML</h2>
<p> HTML is to create the structure of this website. 94% of the website is HTML according to GitHub. It is also a language that I self studied.

<h2>CSS</h2>
<p> CSS to make this website look visually appealing. 6% of the website is CSS according to GitHub. I really love art, so my favorite
  part of CSS is getting to pick just the right shade of lavender with the hexadecimals! It is also another language I self studied.

<h2>R</h2>
<p> I learned R through the Probability and Statistical Modelling Course (MA217). We had several assignments that had to deal with R, including a final project.
 I included a few below.

<h2>Java</h2>
<p> I learned Java and through the courses Computer Science I (CP122) and Computer Science II (CP222). I will also gain even more experience with Java through an upcoming
 course in May, Data Structures and Algorithms (CP307).
