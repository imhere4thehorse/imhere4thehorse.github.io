   About Me

<div id="myear">

 
 <p>
  I am a passionate college student with a strong desire to learn more about the Computer Science Field.
  I became interested in the Computer Science field this past year, but my enthusiasm for this subject
  motivated me to self-study languages such as Python, CSS, and HTML as well as take upper-level classes
  (that mostly sophomores and juniors take) as a freshman in college.
<br>
  Although I am more new to the field of Computer Science, I have continued to hone and develop the critical
 and creative thinking skills that are crucial to this subject through my involvement in the Technology Student Association (TSA)
 club in my high school and challenging myself to take difficult, upper level courses. I recieved several awards
 for both my creative and logistical thinking, notably the 2nd Place Award in the Biotechnology Design event for a TSA competition
 and a Silver Key in Science Fiction and Fantasy Writing for the Scholastic Art and Writing Awards competition. My skills
 in both creative thinking and critical thinking will further enhance my education and experience within the field of Computer Science.
<br>
 Through the different courses I am taking in school, I am learning more and more about Computer Science as well as how other subjects,
 such as Organismal Biology and Ecology, can connect with topics this field. However, I am looking to further challenge myself
 by experiencing Computer Science within the real world, which is why an internship position truly excites me.
