 I am a first year student at Colorado College, a small liberal arts school in Colorado Springs. Although it isn't a school that has a heavy
 focus in the tech field, I chose to attend this school to study Computer Science because of the unique way of thinking a liberal arts education
 will offer me.
 <br>
 <br>
 A liberal arts education at Colorado College offers me a vastly different perspective than those going to more traditional universities.
 <br>
 <br>
 At CC, I learn by the <a href="https://www.coloradocollege.edu/basics/blockplan/">Block Plan</a>, which means that I am taking only one course for 3.5 weeks.
 As of November, I am currently in Block 3, and my experience from the first two blocks, as well as a two week block before class officially started during 
 my time in the <a href="https://www.coloradocollege.edu/other/bridge/">Bridge Scholars Program</a>, I learned to be quickly be adaptable. Personally,
 I found that the Block Plan doesn't allow me to truly settle in and relax in my class, which means I must be able to think effectively and engage myself in
 my education in order to understand the content within my class. The second I feel somewhat used to my environment in one block, I am suddenly thrust into
 a different block--possibly with very different concepts--and I must adapt to the pace and the content of the course. This happened to me during Blocks 1 and 2.
 For Block 1, I had a class called Acting and Directing for the Cinema, which was greatly different from Block 2, Foundations of Discrete Mathematics. Yet, I had to quickly
 make the adjustment to succeed in my following block.
 <br>
 <br>
 Not only am I learning the skills to work well under pressure and adapt to greatly different environments, but I am also getting the opportunity to support my
 journey in my pursuit of a Computer Science degree through intellectual grounding in many different fields. In order to graduate Colorado College, students must
 complete their <a href="https://www.coloradocollege.edu/other/generaleducation/requirements.html">General Education</a> requirements, which allows students to expand
 their knowledge and thinking through analysis and interpretation of meaning, creative processes, formal reasoning, historical perspectives, scientific analysis,
 interpretation of socities and human behavior, education in equity and power, as well as engagement through language(both foreign and native). Although some
 of the subjects I am learning are not necessarily related to Computer Science, the way those courses shape my thinking and my perspective can greatly improve
 the way I handle situations within the field.
